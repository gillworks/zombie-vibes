# Zombie Vibes

A 3D zombie survival game inspired by Project Zomboid, built with Three.js.

## Overview

Zombie Vibes is an isometric survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Unlike traditional zombie games, our zombies have unique personalities, behaviors, and "vibes" that make each encounter different and challenging.

## Features (Planned)

- **Unique Zombie Types**: Each zombie has different behaviors, abilities, and weaknesses
- **Isometric 3D World**: Built with Three.js for smooth performance in the browser
- **Survival Mechanics**: Manage hunger, thirst, and fatigue while scavenging for supplies
- **Base Building**: Construct and fortify shelters to survive the zombie apocalypse
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Different challenges emerge when darkness falls

## Development

This project is in early development. The current version is an MVP to demonstrate core gameplay mechanics.

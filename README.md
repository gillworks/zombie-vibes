# Zombie Vibes

A 3D zombie survival game inspired by Project Zomboid, built with Three.js.

## Overview

Zombie Vibes is an isometric survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Unlike traditional zombie games, our zombies have unique personalities, behaviors, and "vibes" that make each encounter different and challenging.

## Features

- **Unique Zombie Types**: Each zombie has different behaviors, abilities, and weaknesses
- **Isometric 3D World**: Built with Three.js for smooth performance in the browser
- **Camera Follow System**: Camera follows the player, keeping them centered on screen
- **Intuitive Controls**: Camera-relative movement and right-mouse rotation

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move (relative to camera view)
- **Right Mouse Button**: Rotate camera
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Left Click**: Attack zombies

## Zombie Types

Our game features several unique zombie types, each with their own behaviors and characteristics:

1. **Shambler** (Dark Red)

   - Classic slow-moving zombie
   - Moderate health and damage
   - The traditional zombie experience

2. **Runner** (Orange-Red)

   - Fast but weaker zombie
   - Low health but quick movement
   - Can quickly overwhelm you if ignored

3. **Tank** (Purple)

   - Slow but very strong zombie
   - High health and damage
   - Requires strategy to defeat

4. **Spitter** (Green)

   - Can attack from a distance
   - Shoots projectiles at the player
   - Moderate health and speed

5. **Screamer** (Yellow)
   - Attracts other zombies when near player
   - Increases nearby zombies' speed temporarily
   - Should be prioritized in group encounters
